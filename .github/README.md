### Login inside the dashboard.
 After that, you have to log in to your dashboard. 
### Make sure you are admin

Next you will have to click on the button that says "Settings" This button can be found in the administrative area from inside the sidebar.
### Enable and paste the new css
After that, scroll down to custom CSS and enable it, then paste your code inside the code field and save.  

## Are those themes under copyright? 
Yes, every theme is under copyright, and it has its own license file inside the theme folder. You should respect that license!

## How can I upload my own custom CSS?
Firstly, you have to understand how github works.

### Fork the repository
First, you will have to fork the repository, so you can access it.

### Create a good name for it
Now you will have to create a new folder inside the repository. This should be your theme name, e.g., "LithumaThemeOrange". Make sure you don't use any swear words or any kind of offensive language.

###  Fill in the requirements.
So  first you will have to create a new file called `style.css`. Now enter that file and paste your custom CSS. The next step is to take a screenshot of the dashboard page with the theme applied to it! Place those screenshots inside the theme folder alongside the `style.css` file.

### Adding a copyright to the theme.
Now that you have a theme, you will have to edit the LICENSE file and add your name. Just add a new line under `Copyright (c) 2023 MythicalSystems LTD`. Your copyright shall look like this: `Copyright (c) 2023 YourGithubName`.

### Adding a theme preview inside the README.
Now you will have to create a new README file inside the directory and paste this and replace it with your info.
```
Name: the theme name

Author: the theme author (Discord tag or Github username)

Version: the mythicaldash version (v2.0.x)

```

### Publish the theme.
First, you will have to push the changes to your forked repository and open a new pull request.

### Wait for your theme to be verified and merged!
This is the latest step. Please do not ping any of the MythicalSystems staff members to merge your theme, etc.

## Are pull requests to make another theme look better allowed?
Yes, they are, but there are some limits over here:
### 1–20 lines of code 
Allowed and you can add your name to the license.
### 20–Unlimited lines of code 
This will require creating a new theme!
### This does not apply to the theme author.

## Can I DMCA a user if a user steals my theme and uploads it here under another name or with his name?
No, you can't DMCA or start harassing the user, etc.
The right way is by opening an issue about that and posting proof and more info about what was stolen, etc.

## I want my theme to be deleted.
In that case, we can't help you because anything that gets merged won't be removed. The only thing you can do is transfer the copyright to MythicalSystems from the README file inside your theme folder.

## I want to change my theme name.
You can't do that, and we are sorry!
